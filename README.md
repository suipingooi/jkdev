## Milestone Project 1 : User Centric Front-end Development 

### Project Purpose - Who am I?

Who am I? This is a question that plaque most individuals as we grow and adapt throughout our lifetime. It is a "major" question, especially for a child transitioning from childhood to adulthood as they test their boundaries and figure out their sense of self and identity. The aim of this project is twofold.

1. Allow JK to develop awareness of his sense of self, organize his thoughts and belief structure as he builds on his character development.

2. Organizes JK's whole child domain developments into identity groups that will provide educators and school leaders a more comprehensive picture as they consider JK for direct school admission (DSA) into secondary one. 

"Who am I?" is a project with the ultimate goal of placing JK into a secondary school that will fit his personality and the family's values. This is crucial as the teenage stage in secondary school will influence deeply and form the basis of JK's identity as he exits this transitional stage and into adulthood.

Users of this site are educators, senior teachers and school leaders who are **key decision makers** in the outcome of JK's DSA application. The information provided by JK's primary school will be limited to happenings in school and remarks by teachers who have spent time with him - to them, he is a student leader. However, a child only spends half their time at school! This site aims to provide the other side of the coin in a bid to provide key decision makers an **insight** into what drives and motivates JK's behaviour. 

## UX - User Experience

Users will land on JK's mainpage that subvertly calls them to attention with "Who am I?" and a quote by aristotle. This should ingeniously inform them that this site will let them find out more about JK. JK's developmental domains can be explored by clicking on the icon buttons.

![Responsive Web Design Demo](images/core/demo.png)
The design of this site aims to be clean, straighforward, organized and uncluttered. The colors and typography used are a personification of JK.

![Color Chart](images/core/colorchart.jpeg)
Extensive use of Grey and Orange across the platform to convey a clean message of JK's personality: balance, warmth, enthusiasm, excitement and neutrality. A contrast color of turquoise adds a touch of sophistication that represents his softer side: tranquility, serenity, and wisdom.
![Font Gylps](images/core/fontgylps.png)
Eczar, serif and Montserrat, san-serif were selected as font-pair that is simple and modern yet suggestive of heritage.

5. Gimp 2.10 [https://www.gimp.org/](https://www.gimp.org/)
    * Image manipulation - cropping and adding transparency to icon created with keynote icons.


## Testing

The demo link via [Github Pages](https://suipingooi.github.io/jkdev/) was sent to JK's grandparents and extended family for testing outside of Singapore. This was done for the following reasons:
1. JK's grandparents have not visited since the Covid19 lockdown and this demo site allows for them to catch up on his development in the past year.
2. They are also aged with limited IT experience which allows a guage on intuitive UI/UX ability whilst on a variety of devices (ipad, iphone, samsung mobile and huawei mobile) 
3. Their location in Malaysia with possibly slower internet connection also allows a check on media capability.

Suggestions were taken into account and amendments made.

[W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) testing was done for all html files. All errors corrected and suggestion for language included. No errors found at last deployment.

[Jigsaw CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) testing was done for css file. No error was found.

**Unresolved Issues**

Visted links does not gray out on mobile (specifically iphone11). A check was also done on two(2) samsung phones running chrome as well as macbook pro running safari - no issues found with change in color for visted links for these devices. Further testing required.


## Deployment

A demo of this development is deployed on Github Pages. Deployment was uneventful.
